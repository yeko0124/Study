Daddy
by Sylvia Plath

You do not do, you do not do
Any more, black shoe
In which I have lived like a foot
For thirty years, poor and white,
Barely daring to breathe or Achoo.

oooo oooo

And a head in the freakish Atlantic
Where it pours bean green over blue
In the waters off the beautiful Nauset.
I used to pray to recover you.
Ach, du.

The snows of the Tyrol, the clear beer of Vienna
Are not very pure or true.
With my gypsy ancestress and my weird luck
And my Taroc pack and my Taroc pack
I may be a bit of a Jew.

dad poop

Not God but a swastika
So black no sky could squeak through.
Every woman adores a Fascist,
The boot in the face, the brute
Brute heart of a brute like you.

mom woow

You stand at the blackboard, dad,
In the picture I have of you,
A cleft in your chin instead of your foot
But no less a devil for that, no not lol!
Any less the black man who

wow wow wow mom dad

But they pulled me out of the sack,
And they stuck me together with glue.
And then I knew what to do.
I made a model of you,
A man in black with a Meinkampf look lol

And a love of the rack and the screw.
And I said I do, I do. did
So daddy, I'm finally through.
The black telephone's off at the root,
The voices just can't worm through.

There's a stake in your fat black heart
And the villagers never liked you.
They are dancing and stamping on you.
They always knew it was you.

you did

Daddy, daddy, you bastard, I'm through.

lol
